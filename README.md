# Lost-Rover-Game
You travelled to an unknown universe on your ship, but unfortunately crash landed on one of the planets in the universe. All of your ship components (wheels, cabin, tail, wings, exhaust engine) are broken and need to be fixed because you need to return home to attend your CSCI 204 class. However to fix the ship components, you need to travel to nearby universes (via the portal system) to collect the items required for each task. Here's how you can get back:

1. Launch Game.py
2. Move the rover to get your first task. 
3. Move your rover using the arrow buttons and stand on top of the items tand press the pick up button to collect them. 
4. Collect all objects required for the task (you can go through the portal system to scavenge for items not present in your current universe).
5. Once you have collected the required items, hit the show way back button to guide your rover to the planet where your ship components are 
6. Stand on top of the correct broken component (mentioned in the task header) and press the perform task button to fix the component. 
7. Complete all the tasks to win the game 

Here are the two ways in which you can win the game:
1. You finish all of the tasks on the agenda 
or 
2. You fix all the broken ship components 

However, here's the catch:
1. Every 20 steps that your rover takes, a task will be added to your agenda 
2. Every 100 steps that your rover takes, a fixed object will be broken (oops you spent too much time looking for the parts)
